# AlbumAficionado

Currently a work in progress, Album Aficionado is an app for music lovers that allows them to view curated lists of the top 10 albums in most musical genres. Users can view information/album art for individual albums, tick off albums they've listened to, and view their 'listened to' stats. Premium users can build their own custom lists, and see how their 'listened to' stats compare to other app users.

Album Aficionado uses: UIKit, Firebase (Firestore), MVVM, Core Animation, StoreKit, Core Data, UserDefaults, WikipediaKit, Networking, Push Notifications, async/await
